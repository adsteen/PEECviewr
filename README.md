# PEECviewr
toy data viewer for PEEC/UT brownification project

This shiny app (now hosted on [shinyapps.io](http://adsteen.shinyapps.io/PEECviewr) serves as an example of the kind of thing we would build as part of a UT/PEEC project to monitor brownification in the source waters of the Delaware River using citizen science.
